# Grade Calculator

This PHP program prompts the user to enter their grade (out of 100) for a course and calculates their letter grade and percentage score based on a grading scale. The program uses conditional statements to determine the user's letter grade and percentage score based on their grade, and uses arithmetic operators to calculate the user's percentage score based on the number of credits for the course.

## Grading Scale

The grading scale used in this program is as follows:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

Assuming that the course is worth 3 credits and that the maximum possible points for the course is 4.0 per credit.

1. Clone or download the code from the repository.
2. Open the file in a PHP editor or run it on a web server with PHP installed.
3. Enter your grade when prompted by the program.
4. The program will output a message that includes your grade, letter grade, and percentage score in the following format:

   where X is your grade, Y is your letter grade, and Z is your percentage score rounded to two decimal places.
