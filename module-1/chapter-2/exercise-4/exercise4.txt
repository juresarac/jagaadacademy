Asumming that you have made some changes to the 'my-feature' branch and have not committed them yet, 
you can use the following commnands to switch to the 'release-v2' branch, make a qucik fic,
commit the changes, and then switch back to the 'my-feature' branch
Steps:
1. Save the changes in current branch:
	git stash save "Temporary save my-feature changes"
2. Switch to the 'release-v2' branch:
	git checkout release-v2
3. Make the fix and commit the changes:
	git add .
	git commit -m 'Qucik fix for release-v2'
4. Switch to my-feature branch:
	git checkout my-feature
5. Reatrive the changes:

These commands will save your changes on the my-feature branch temporarily, 
switch to the release-v2 branch, 
make the quick fix, commit the changes, switch back to the my-feature branch, 
and then retrieve the changes that you stashed earlier so you can continue working where you left off.
